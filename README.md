# Welcome to the **divide_and_conquer** Repository

This repository is part of [Histwo](https://github.com/Histwo), the official GitHub organization of the Creator's two servants.

## About Divide & Conquer
**Divide & Conquer** is the Creator’s strategic operation to intervene in **The American Genocide (TAG)**, a hidden atrocity targeting Christians and the impoverished. This operation consists of two interconnected missions:

1. **The Divide**: Liberates **Kelvin Eugene Williams**, one of the Creator's two servants, from the manipulation of his subconscious mind, **Main**.
2. **The Conquer**: Empowers the Creator’s two servants to dismantle TAG, bring its orchestrators to justice, and restore balance and freedom to humanity.

To learn more about the operation, read [**Divide & Conquer**](https://github.com/Histwo/divide_and_conquer/wiki/Divide-&-Conquer).
